<h1>Practice, Practice, Practice</h1>

<font color=red>Read Chapter 5: Complete Search</font> from the text.  This
discusses various ways of covering a search space and will lead us into a
discussion of different algorithm classes
<hr>
This week we are working in teams of 3.  Do the initial analysis together and
then start to learn how to schedule the keyboard / screen.  Figure out how many
of the problems each can solve individually and overlap design with coding to
make better use of the limited resource (the keyboard / screen).  Once you have
exhausted the problems that can be done individually, work together to design,
code, test, and debug the harder problems.
<p>
Working on teams of three requires more attention paid to budgeting the 
keyboard / screen resource effectively.  Practice switching from problem to 
problem as coding is finished and tests need to be written or bugs need to
be found.  Don't leave two people idle while one person stares at the screen.
Learn to read and debug someone else's code.

While you do these problems, keep good records on how much time you are
spending in the following areas:
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li> Understanding (What do they want?)
<li> Recognition (Ahh!  That's what they want and here's how I'll do it)
<li> Ranking (trivial, easy, medium, hard, impossible)
<li> Sizing (time / space complexity)
<li> Time Estimate (how long to code up)
<li> Ordering (how would you order these problems for solving)
</ul>
<h3> The Problems</h3>
<ol>
<li> Analysis (see above)
<li> Coding (just the physical typing of code)
<li> Testing (setting up and running tests)
<li> Debugging (time spent fixing problems found in <i>Testing</i>)
<li> Re-coding (any time spent re-designing / re-writing you solution.  Does
     not include time fixing bugs)
<li> Total time to solution (including steps 2-5 above)
<li> Record the number of failed submissions
</ol>
