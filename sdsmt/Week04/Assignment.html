<h1>Practice, Practice, Practice</h1>
<hr>
<font color=red>Read Chapter 4: Data Structures</font>.  Make sure you
understand and can use dynamic arrays, sets, and maps from the STL.  If you
haven't had CSC 315: Data Structures, spend extra time looking at, and asking
questions about, priority queue (heap), and hashes/trees (used in STL 
implementations of unordered_maps/unordered_sets and maps/sets respectively)

This week we are working in teams of 2.  Do the initial analysis together and
then start to learn how to schedule the keyboard / screen.  Figure out how many
of the problems each can solve individually and overlap design with coding to
make better use of the limited resource (the keyboard / screen).  Once you have
exhausted the problems that can be done individually, work together to design,
code, test, and debug the harder problems.

While you do these problems, keep good records on how much time you are
spending in the following areas:
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li> Understanding (What do they want?)
<li> Recognition (Ahh!  That's what they want and here's how I'll do it)
<li> Ranking (trivial, easy, medium, hard, impossible)
<li> Sizing (time / space complexity)
<li> Time Estimate (how long to code up)
<li> Ordering (how would you order these problems for solving)
</ul>
<h3> The Problems</h3>
<ol>
<li> Analysis (see above)
<li> Coding (just the physical typing of code)
<li> Testing (setting up and running tests)
<li> Debugging (time spent fixing problems found in <i>Testing</i>)
<li> Re-coding (any time spent re-designing / re-writing you solution.  Does
     not include time fixing bugs)
<li> Total time to solution (including steps 2-5 above)
<li> Record the number of failed submissions
</ol>
