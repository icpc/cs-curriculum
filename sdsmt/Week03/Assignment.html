While you do these problems, keep good records on how much time you are
spending in the following areas:
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li> Understanding (What do they want?)
<li> Recognition (Ahh!  That's what they want and here's how I'll do it)
<li> Ranking (trivial, easy, medium, hard, impossible)
<li> Sizing (time / space complexity)
<li> Time Estimate (how long to code up)
<li> Ordering (how would you order these problems for solving)
</ul>
<h3> The Problems</h3>
<ol>
<li> Analysis (see above)
<li> Coding (just the physical typing of code)
<li> Testing (setting up and running tests)
<li> Debugging (time spent fixing problems found in <i>Testing</i>)
<li> Re-coding (any time spent re-designing / re-writing you solution.  Does
     not include time fixing bugs)
<li> Total time to solution (including steps 2-5 above)
<li> Record the number of failed submissions
</ol>
