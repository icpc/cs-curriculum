<h1>Week 2 - Floating Point Arithmetic</h1>
<hr>
Some reading is in order especially for those of you new to competitive
programming.  Understanding things like representable range of values for
various primitive data types and the limitations of precision due to floating
point number representation in computers are both very important if you want
to be successful.
<p>
A document that can really help you understand the issues around all things
concerning floating point arithmetic in computers is:
<blockquote>
What every computer scientist should know about floating point arithmetic. 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html">[pdf]</a>
</blockquote>
Read sections from the beginning through <b>Relative Error and Ulps</b> and
<B>Languages and Compilers</b> through <b>Optimizers</b>
<p>
This will give you a complete description of floating point arithmetic and how 
it is handled by hardware, software, and compilers including the impact of 
things like substitutions (e.g. x/2.0 -&gt; x * 0.5 vs x/10.0 -&gt; x * 0.1) 
and expression simplification like x*y - x*z -&gt; x*(y-z).
<p>
It may require a number of readings and writing some example code before it 
really starts to sink in.
<p>
There are 10 problems in this week's assignment.  <b>Before</b> attempting any 
of the problems, complete the usual analysis of the problems:
<h3>Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li> Understanding (What do they want?)
<li> Recognition (Ahh!  That's what they want and here's how I'll do it)
<li> Ranking (trivial, easy, medium, hard, impossible)
<li> Sizing (time / space complexity)
<li> Time Estimate (how long to code up)
<li> Ordering (how would you order these problems for solving)
</ul>
<h3> The Problems</h3>

</ul>
While you do these problems, keep good records on how much time you are
spending in the following areas:
<ol>
<li> Analysis (see above)
<li> Coding (just the physical typing of code)
<li> Testing (setting up and running tests)
<li> Debugging (time spent fixing problems found in <i>Testing</i>)
<li> Re-coding (any time spent re-designing / re-writing you solution.  Does
     not include time fixing bugs)
<li> Total time to solution (including steps 2-5 above)
<li> Record the number of failed submissions
</ol>
